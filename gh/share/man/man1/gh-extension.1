.SH NAME
.PP
gh-extension - Manage gh extensions


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCgh extension [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
GitHub CLI extensions are repositories that provide additional gh commands.

.PP
The name of the extension repository must start with "gh-" and it must contain an
executable of the same name. All arguments passed to the \fB\fCgh <extname>\fR invocation
will be forwarded to the \fB\fCgh-<extname>\fR executable of the extension.

.PP
An extension cannot override any of the core gh commands. If an extension name conflicts
with a core gh command you can use \fB\fCgh extension exec <extname>\fR\&.

.PP
