.SH NAME
.PP
gh-release-create - Create a new release


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCgh release create [<tag>] [<files>...]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Create a new GitHub Release for a repository.

.PP
A list of asset files may be given to upload to the new release. To define a
display label for an asset, append text starting with \fB\fC#\fR after the file name.

.PP
If a matching git tag does not yet exist, one will automatically get created
from the latest state of the default branch. Use \fB\fC--target\fR to override this.
To fetch the new tag locally after the release, do \fB\fCgit fetch --tags origin\fR\&.

.PP
To create a release from an annotated git tag, first create one locally with
git, push the tag to GitHub, then run this command.

.PP
When using automatically generated release notes, a release title will also be automatically
generated unless a title was explicitly passed. Additional release notes can be prepended to
automatically generated notes by using the notes parameter.
